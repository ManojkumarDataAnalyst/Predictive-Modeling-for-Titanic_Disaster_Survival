# Predictive-Modeling-for-Titanic_Disaster_Survival
Analyzed the Titanic disaster dataset to uncover insights about factors influencing passenger survival.
Cleaned and prepared the data, addressing missing values and outliers to ensure accurate analysis.
Utilized exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to visualize passenger demographics, ticket classes, and survival rates.
Employed statistical methods to assess correlations between variables, revealing trends such as higher survival rates for certain age groups or passenger classes.
Developed informative visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate findings effectively.
Derived meaningful conclusions about the factors that contributed to passenger survival in the Titanic disaster.
